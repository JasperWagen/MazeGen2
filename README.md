#MazeGen2

## Make and solve mazes till your heart's content

## Description
MazeGen2 is the follow up to the unsuccessful and abandoned MazeGen. Originally implemented in Scala, I've now re-written it in Python for no good reason other than I like Python and it's easy.

In order for this project to work in Python, however, I have had to overhaul the maze generation and solving algorithms. The resulting depth first search and recursive backtracking algorithms are now much more performant (although I'm sure I made some blunders somewhere).

If you're interested in downloading this for yourself there's some make commands that will spin the website up in a docker container.

Peace.
